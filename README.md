According to Microsoft, Windows 10 will reach its "end of life" on October 14, 2025. After this date, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates, technical support, or new features for the operating system.

Now, let‚Äôs say your company doesn't have the budget to invest in a centralized system for deploying Windows updates across both supported and unsupported hardware to Windows 11. As an administrator, you've identified over 1,000 computers running Windows 10 within your company‚Äôs network.

To tackle this challenge and avoid unnecessary costs, **Upgrade_Engine.ps1** comes into play.

What is **Upgrade_Engine.ps1**?
Upgrade_Engine.ps1 is a PowerShell script developed by **AuxGrep** to help administrators seamlessly upgrade Windows 10 workstations to Windows 11 Pro. It works silently via Group Policy from a Domain Controller (DC), using a single Windows 11 ISO file shared over the local network‚Äîno internet required.

**How Does It Work?**
1. Automatically copies the shared Windows 11 ISO to the user‚Äôs PC.
2. Initiates the upgrade process silently‚Äîusers won't be asked any questions.
3. Keeps all user files intact‚Äîno data loss or manual intervention required.

Once the upgrade is complete, it notifies the user to restart their machine.
Even after the restart, the script continues managing the process‚Äîensuring a smooth transition.
**No need for manual input, no complicated steps‚Äîjust tell your users to sit back, grab a beer, and relax!** üçª
